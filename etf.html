            <h2>What is an ETF?</h2>
            <p>An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund and exchange-traded product, meaning they are traded on stock exchanges. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of ETFs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equity ETFs:</strong> These ETFs invest in stocks and are designed to track the performance of a specific index like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq-100.</li>
                <li><strong>Bond ETFs:</strong> These invest in bonds and can include government bonds, corporate bonds, and state and local bonds (municipal bonds).</li>
                <li><strong>Commodity ETFs:</strong> These ETFs invest in commodities such as gold, oil, or agricultural products.</li>
                <li><strong>Sector and Industry ETFs:</strong> These focus on a specific sector or industry, like technology, healthcare, or energy.</li>
                <li><strong>International ETFs:</strong> These ETFs provide exposure to markets outside of the country of the investor.</li>
                <li><strong>Actively Managed ETFs:</strong> Unlike most ETFs, these are not designed to track an index. Instead, the portfolio manager makes decisions about which assets to include in the ETF.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Benefits of ETFs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> ETFs allow investors to buy a collection of assets in a single transaction, which can reduce risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Expense Ratios:</strong> ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds because they are passively managed.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> ETFs trade like stocks, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> ETFs are required to disclose their holdings daily, providing investors with a clear picture of the assets they own.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> ETFs generally have lower capital gains due to their structure, which can be more tax-efficient for investors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Invest in ETFs</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose a Brokerage:</strong> To invest in ETFs, you'll need a brokerage account. Look for a brokerage that offers a wide selection of ETFs and low trading fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Research ETFs:</strong> Consider what you want to achieve with your investment. Are you looking for growth, income, or diversification? Use resources like ETF screeners to find ETFs that match your investment goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Place an Order:</strong> Once you've selected an ETF, you can place a buy order through your brokerage account. ETFs can be bought and sold during market hours just like stocks.</li>

                <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some ETFs may have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell shares without affecting the market price.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking Error:</strong> The performance of an ETF may not perfectly match the performance of the index or assets it is designed to track.</li>
                <li><strong>Sector or Industry Risk:</strong> Sector or industry ETFs can be more volatile if the specific sector or industry experiences downturns.</li>
